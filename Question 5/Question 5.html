<h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
<p>This is the normal text as you can see.</p>

<div>

        And this is the text that I'm supposed to put in the box or the div,
        I'm not sure. I don't really know if I understood the question right
        so I'm going with that and we shall see if that was the right decision.
        Have a nice day, corrector :)
