<h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
<p>This is the normal text as you can see. I need to make to longer to see if it shrinks of if it
    automatically goes to the next line. That should be enough.
</p>

<div>
    <p>
        And this is the text that I'm supposed to put in the box or the div,
        I'm not sure. I don't really know if I understood the question right
        so I'm going with that and we shall see if that was the right decision.
        Have a nice day, corrector :)
